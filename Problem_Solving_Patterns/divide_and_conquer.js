// DIVIDE AND CONQUER PATTERN

// This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
// This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.

// Example
// Given an array of sorted integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1.

// Linear Search - Time Complexity O(N)

// Binary Search is a Divide and Conquer Algorithm with a Time Complexity - Log(N)
