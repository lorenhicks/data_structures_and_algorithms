// OBJECTIVES
// Define what an algorithm is
// Devise a plan to solve algorithms
// Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

// WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM
// A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

// WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW THIS
// Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
// It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

// HOW DO YOU IMPROVE
// Devise a plan for solving problems
// Master common problem solving patterns

// PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES
// Understand the problem
// Explore concrete examples
// Break it down
// Solve/Simplify
// Look back and refactor
