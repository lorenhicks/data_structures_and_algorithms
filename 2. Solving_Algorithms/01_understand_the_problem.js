// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
// Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem or will I during the course of solving it?)
// How should I label data that are part of the problem?

// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    "Ints, floats, string for large numbers?"
// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    "Int? Float? String?"
// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem or will I during the course of solving it?)

// How should I label data that are part of the problem?
